# Neural_Networks_TimeSeries

In this project I tried to solve time series problem for BFO stock using various regression algorithms which include basic Linear Regression, Random Forest regressor, LSTM+DNN model and 1D-CNN-LSTM-DNN model. All of the models had a great performance, achieving 94-97% in R2 metric. Besides that, all the results were visualised using facebooks Prophet library.
